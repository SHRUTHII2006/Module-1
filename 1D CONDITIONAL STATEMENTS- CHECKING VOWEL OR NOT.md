## Experiment No: 1d â€“ Conditional Statements- Checking positive or not

## AIM  
To Write a Python program to read a value and print that number is equal to 0 or positive number or negative using elif statement.
## ALGORITHM  

1.Begin the program and read a number from the user using input() and convert it to int or float.

2.Use an if statement to check if the number is equal to 0 and print "The number is zero".

3.Use an elif statement to check if the number is greater than 0 and print "The number is positive".

4.Use an else statement to print "The number is negative" if the above conditions are false, then terminate the program.



## PROGRAM

a=int(input())

if a==0:

    print("Number is 0")
    
elif a>0:

    print(a,"is a Positive number")
    
else:

    print(a,"is a Negative number")
